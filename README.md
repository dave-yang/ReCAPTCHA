ReCAPTCHA 1.0 Provider
====================

This is a modern replacement for legacy ReCAPTCHA implementation.


Why is it better?


- OOP approach is used, only one class
- Adhering to SoC and PSR-FIG
- Handle errors correctly
- Much easier to read the code and maintain it

It's easy now to integrate the service into your framework/library, as it encapsulates its implementation and required class can be autoloaded on demand.
To get started, just take a peek at provided example (located in: `/example-recaptcha.php`).
